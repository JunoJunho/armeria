# Customizing a `ClientFactory` with `ClientFactoryBuilder`

A <type://ClientFactory> manages connections and protocol-specific properties.
You can customize the properties via <type://ClientFactoryBuilder>. For example,
let's say that you want to increase the connection timeout.

```java
final ClientFactory factory =
                ClientFactory.builder()
                             // Increase the connection timeout to 5 seconds.
                             .connectTimeoutMillis(5000)
                             .build());
final WebClient client = WebClient.builder("http://armeria.com")
                                  .factory(factory)
                                  .build();
client.get("/api").aggregate().join();
```

The client created with the given <type://ClientFactory> will respect the settings such as connection timeout
that you defined.
You might notice that the clients, which are created using the same <type://ClientFactory>,
share the connection pool. If you don't want to share the connections among the clients,
you should use different <typeplural://ClientFactory>.
For the complete list of properties, see <type://ClientFactoryBuilder>.

<Tip>

  You might want to take a look at <type://ClientBuilder> to distinguish the client-specific properties.

</Tip>

You can also use <type://ClientFactoryOptions> to build <type://ClientFactory>.
It's more verbose than calling a dedicated setter method, but it can be useful when you need to
set a series of options programmatically.

## Lifecycle of `ClientFactory`

Most clients for a <type://ClientFactory> need to send requests to another server for the lifetime of a process.
The fact is that when <type://ClientFactory> is closed for some reasons,
clients which were spawned from the <type://ClientFactory>, will also be closed.
Therefore, you will generally avoid closing the <type://ClientFactory>, except for perhaps in a shutdown hook,
to avoid losing connections to the other servers.
For unit tests where a <type://ClientFactory> is only used for a single test or test class,
it is appropriate to close it when done using it.
It might be good suggestion keeping your <type://ClientFactory> lifecycle same as application's lifecycle.

## Specifying Netty `ChannelOption`s

You can also specify Netty [`ChannelOption`](https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/channel/ChannelOption.html)
via <type://ClientFactoryBuilder#channelOption(ChannelOption,T)>:

```java
final ClientFactory factory =
        ClientFactory.builder()
                     // Set the size of send socket buffer as 4096 bytes
                     .channelOption(ChannelOption.SO_SNDBUF, 4096)
                     .build();
// Do something with factory
WebClient.builder().factory(factory).build();
```

## Specifying different `EventLoop` threads for different endpoints

By default, Armeria keeps at most 1 connection per endpoint (host and port pair) in case of using HTTP/2,
which is desirable for typical HTTP/2 services. Armeria achieves this by assigning one `EventLoop` per endpoint
from the <type://ServerConfig#workerGroup()>. However, there's a limit to the requests that
a single connection(or `EventLoop` which is a thread) can handle, so you might want to increase
the number of connections(or `EventLoop` threads) for certain or all endpoints.

You can do this via <type://ClientFactoryBuilder#maxNumEventLoopsPerEndpoint(int)>:

The <type://ClientFactoryBuilder> class has a feature to set the number of `EventLoop` threads using
`maxNumEventLoopsPerEndpoint` and `maxNumEventLoopsFunction`. The former parameter will set the number of `EventLoop`
threads for each endpoint (This parameter is used for HTTP/2.
In HTTP/1, use `maxNumEventLoopsPerHttp1Endpoint` instead.).
It indicates that if you change this value `N`,
then Client instances that are generated by the factory will use distinct `EventLoop` threads per endpoint.

```java
ClientFactory factory =
         ClientFactory.builder()
                      // a client will use maximum 5 EventLoops from the worker group per endpoint
                      .maxNumEventLoopsPerEndpoint(5)
                      .build();
// Do something using factory
WebClient.builder().factory(factory).build();

ClientFactory factory =
        ClientFactory.builder()
                     // or you can just use Integer.MAX_VALUE to use all EventLoops
                     .maxNumEventLoopsPerEndpoint(Integer.MAX_VALUE)
                     .build();
// Do something using factory
WebClient.builder().factory(factory).build();
```

The client might need to send many requests to a certain endpoint, while not bothering other endpoints.
In that situation, you can use <type://ClientFactoryBuilder#maxNumEventLoopsFunction(ToIntFunction)>:

```java
ClientFactory factory =
        ClientFactory.builder()
                     .maxNumEventLoopsFunction(endpoint -> {
                         if (endpoint.equals(Endpoint.of("lotsOfTraffic.com"))) {
                             // We are going to use all EventLoops to send reqeusts.
                             return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                         }
                         // We use just one `EventLoop` per endpoint for the rest.
                         return 1;
                     })
                     .build();
// Do something using factory
WebClient.builder().factory(factory).build();
```

## Customizing TLS

You can configure the TLS settings of your client connection
with <type://ClientFactoryBuilder#tlsCustomizer(Consumer)>.
For example, you could specify a different CA certificate chain or enforce certain cipher suites.

```java
final String resourceRoot = "/path/to/resource/";
ClientFactory builder =
        ClientFactory.builder()
                     .tlsCustomizer(
                             sslCtxBuilder -> sslCtxBuilder.keyManager(
                                     getClass().getResourceAsStream(resourceRoot + "custom.crt"),
                                     getClass().getResourceAsStream(resourceRoot + "private.key"))
                     ).build();
// Do something using factory
WebClient.builder().factory(factory).build();
```
